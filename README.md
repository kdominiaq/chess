# Chess
Ultimately, the game will include making moves using the mouse or chess notation. Executing moves will also be possible in real-time using object detection with YOLOv4. This will be realized by placing cameras over the board. 
## Major target
Learning how to create correct and clean code in python and how to manage multiple libraries in one project, like Pygame, YOLOv4, StockFish etc.
## Status
The game allows the user to play by typing chess notes in the terminal with a chess bot (stochfish).
